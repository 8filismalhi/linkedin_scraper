Nutrition care can help improve the quality of life and outcomes of people with various health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, kidney disease, and more. Nutrition care can also help prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases and complications by promoting healthy eating habits and lifestyle changes.

The nutrition care process is a systematic and standardized approach to providing high-quality nutrition care. It consists of four steps: nutrition assessment, nutrition diagnosis, nutrition intervention, and nutrition monitoring and evaluation.
