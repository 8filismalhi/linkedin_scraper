You have to manage your empire's economy, diplomacy, religion, and public order, while also expanding your territory and fighting your enemies. You can recruit and upgrade a variety of units, from knights and archers to gunpowder and siege weapons. You can also hire mercenaries, crusaders, and explorers to aid your cause.
 
The battles are epic and realistic. You can command thousands of soldiers on huge maps that reflect the terrain and weather of the region. You can use different tactics and formations to outsmart your opponents. You can also siege castles and cities, or defend them from invaders. The battles are affected by factors such as morale, fatigue, experience, and terrain. You can also use special abilities, such as rallying your troops, charging your cavalry, or launching a holy war.

The game also features voice acting for the characters and units, with different accents and languages for each faction.
