## What is Turnitin and How Does It Work?
  
Turnitin is a web-based service that allows you to submit your written work and receive a similarity report that shows how much of your text matches other sources on the internet or in its database. Turnitin also provides tools for instructors to give feedback, grade assignments, and monitor student progress over time.
  
Turnitin works by comparing your text to billions of web pages, books, journals, newspapers, and other sources that are stored in its database or crawled by its web crawler. It then generates a similarity score that indicates the percentage of your text that is similar or identical to other sources. You can view the similarity report and see the highlighted matches, along with the original sources and their URLs.
  
Turnitin also has features that help you improve your writing skills and avoid plagiarism. For example, you can use Turnitin Draft Coachâ¢ to get instant feedback on your citations, paraphrasing, grammar, and spelling as you write. You can also use Turnitin Feedback Studio to receive personalized comments and suggestions from your instructor or peers.
